# About-Us-Onboarding
All things relating to our organization, the Zerobase project and how you can get involved!

## What is Zerobase?
// Quick high-level explanation of the mission of the organization, and what we offer that's unique (like privacy)

## How Do I Use Zerobase?
// Brief overview of basic user flows

## How Does Zerobase Keep My Data Private?
// "Private by design"
// John can answer this the best I think, but in my opinion we should focus not on the computer science here and instead speak in terms of
// what info users/businesses actually expose by using Zerobase. Ex., make it clear that we will NEVER reveal to the public which 
// businesses had how many cases, that would only ever be revealed to public health officials, or Ex. 2 explain how we will NEVER
// tell people who was sick or who may have gotten them sick, that data is not publicly surfaced.
// We should leverage the fact that we're totally open-source here.
// Link to PRIVACY.md
#### How Is Zerobase Implemented?
// "public key crypto", links to our own compsci/data science explanations, links to other resources like Wikipedia page for PKC
// This is just a footnote for people who don't believe our promises. 

## How Can I Contribute to Zerobase?
// MOST IMPORTANT: Link to CONTRIBUTING.md
// Link to Github org (even though we're already in it)
// Link to Slack
// Link to Google Sheet for recording volunteers
// Will let project management fill in the rest of this section
