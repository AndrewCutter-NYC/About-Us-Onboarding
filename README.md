## What is Zerobase?
Zerobase is a smart tracing technology that helps public health officials identify individuals in our communities who have interacted with someone with COVID-19. In light of scarce testing resources, tracing supercharges each available test kit by helping identify the hundreds of untested members of a community that are at risk of infection based on their proximity to an infected individual. You can find more info in the [attached PDF](Zerobase-Basic.pdf).

At its core Zerobase is a location tracker for community hot spots. Businesses, organizations, locations use a designated smartphone to enroll, print out a QR code, and request that every individual entering the premise scan the code. We work with public health agencies to then backtrace potential exposure events in the case that an individual tests positive and notify all affected locations and individuals with next steps.

We offer unparalleled privacy for users by utilizing innovative and powerful cryptography, so you can trust that the sensitive
data relating to an individual's CoV-SARS-2 testing cannot be tampered with and is kept anonymized. Additionally, we're 100% 
open-source, so anyone can audit our code for security and/or privacy concerns at any time.

organizational summary](./Zerobase-Basic.pdf).
